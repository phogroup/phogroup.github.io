### Algorithm improvements
We previously proposed an autoencoder based compression approach to eliminate the need 
for checkpointing in solving time-dependent PDE based inverse problems. We showed 
the viability of this method on a model acoustic-elastic wave propagation problem 
on a box-shaped domain, inverting for a deviation from the prior mean acoustic wave speed. 
This approach wase based on using the Tensorflow SavedModel API where Tensorflow 
models were trained in Python and loaded in C++ to interface with a sophisticated 
discontinuous Galerkin finite element solver. While the approach worked fairly well
--- an overall speedup of ~10% compared to the checkpointing case using CPUs ---
the performance gains were rather lack-luster. 

This year we propose a new method using a novel sparse-dense model approach. This arose 
from the observation that about 90% of the parameters of the autoencoder 
lived in the first encoding layer and last decoding layer --- the layers that 
map from and to the higher dimensional state space. By sparsifying only these layers, we 
reduced the total number of parameters in the autoencoder model by 80% and 
reduced the computational cost of using the autoencoder to solve the inverse problem. 
We found empirically that this reduction in representation power of the autoencoder 
did not negatively impact accuracy in solving the inverse problem. 

### Results
Building upon the results from the previous year in which we showed that an autoencoder compression 
strategy works on an acoustic-elastic inverse problem, we now show scaling results for this approach 
on the model box problem. All results presented here utilize our novel sparse-dense 
autoencoder architecture and implementation.

$$\nabla$$ speedup is the speedup of the gradient computation compared to the checkpointing 
case and $$\mathcal{H}v$$ speedup is the speedup of each Hessian-vector product. 
Relative errors reported here are the average relative error over the whole domain. 
This table shows the scaling of our method to a problem that is 64 times larger 
than the problems considered last year.

#### Moving outside of the box
As a capstone example for this project, we are working on implementing our compression 
approach for an earth-scale seisimic inverse problem. 3 explosion sources are 
places in the north, southeast, and southwest of North America and an array of 
130 seismic sensors throughout the continent record local velocities at each timestep. 
This setup poses a number of additional challenges that have not been faced in the box example:
- More degrees of freedom
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Non-conforming mesh with hanging faces
- Non-uniform per-process work distribution
We are actively working on adapting our compression strategy to this new challenging setup.

We aim to invert for the wave speed throughout the earth, but in particular aim to 
accurately recover the properties of the North American continent. 
The checkpointing strategy yields the inversion results shown above. Results 
using the autoencoder compression strategy are expected in the next month, 
at which point we will submit the work for publication.
